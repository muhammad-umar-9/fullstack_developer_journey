#  Essential JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my **Essential JavaScript** repository, part of my fullstack developer journey. This collection showcases multiple hands-on projects built using **vanilla JavaScript**, designed to strengthen core programming concepts, modern DOM manipulation, and user interface interactivity.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1.  Build a Meme App ‚Äì *Pumpkin's Purrfect Meme Picker*
An interactive meme picker that lets users select their current emotion and receive a matching cat meme!

**Key Features:**
- Dynamically generated emotion-based radio buttons
- Filter memes to show only animated GIFs
- Random meme selection logic with modal support
- Clean separation of data and logic using ES6 modules

**JavaScript Concepts Practiced:**
- `import` / `export` (ES6 Modules)
- DOM manipulation (`querySelector`, `getElementsByClassName`)
- Event handling and delegation (`event.target.id`)
- Array methods: `filter()`, `includes()`
- Dynamic styling using `classList`
- Parent-child DOM traversal with `.parentElement`

### 2. Build a Cookie Consent ‚Äì *Sketchy Consent Modal*
A humorous take on cookie consent forms, simulating a deceptive data collection modal.

**Key Features:**
- Modal appears after delay to simulate loading
- Fake form submission with personalized response
- ‚ÄúDecline‚Äù button swaps position for trickiness
- Close button becomes available only after processing

**JavaScript Concepts Practiced:**
- `setTimeout()` for timed execution
- Direct style manipulation (`element.style`)
- Form handling using `FormData`
- `event.preventDefault()` for custom submission
- Class toggling (`classList.toggle()`)
- Use of the `disabled` attribute to manage interactivity

**CSS Concepts:**
- Flexbox manipulation using `row-reverse`
- Responsive and interactive UI with visual feedback

### 3. X Clone Project ‚Äì *Twimba: A Twitter Clone*
A feature-rich mini Twitter clone built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äîdemonstrating modern frontend capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Post, like, retweet, reply, and delete tweets
- Live character counter with dynamic styling
- Persistent tweet data using Local Storage
- Real-time app statistics: likes, retweets, tweet count
- UUID generation for unique tweet IDs

**JavaScript Concepts Practiced:**
- DOM manipulation & dynamic rendering
- Form validation and input handling
- Array methods: `forEach()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `find()`, `unshift()`
- Conditional rendering based on state
- Event delegation using `data-*` attributes
- Local Storage integration (`localStorage.getItem()` / `setItem()`)
- External libraries via CDNs (Font Awesome, UUID, Google Fonts)

##  Learning Outcomes

Each project in this repository was built with the goal of strengthening my understanding of:

- Core JavaScript fundamentals and modern ES6+ syntax
- Modular code structure and best practices
- DOM interaction, UI event handling, and state management
- Working with browser APIs (LocalStorage, FormData)
- Building clean, responsive, and interactive UIs
- Managing project files and assets in a scalable structure
